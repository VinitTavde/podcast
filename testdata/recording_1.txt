I remember I was not disciplined at all in terms of my eating and my fitness. I mean, I can't even relate to that guy anymore that I was in those years, you know. So I had played IPL from 2008, 9, 10, 11, and then 12 IPL. 12 was I, I was playing for India. I was playing for the national team at the highest level, but I hadn't got the success, you know, that some of the established players did. And IPL 2012 again, had a really, really bad IPL season and my eating habits were horrible in that season. Very, very bad. And I can remember coming back home and I came out of the shower, the team didn't do well. I came out of the shower, I looked my, looked at myself in the mirror and I was like, that's the time it hit me, you know, and, and luckily everything that's, that's been bad in me somehow I get that calling myself that you need to get it right. Like there hardly anyone coming and telling me, you know, you're really messing up. It just comes from within. And then I saw myself in the mirror and I was like, you can't look like that if you're an international cricketer, you know, I was like, how the hell are you going to continue like this if you don't take care of yourself? Boom. From next day onwards, I just changed everything about my diet. Hitting the gym two hours a day, just taking a day off in a week, eating proper lean food. I got away from all kinds of, you know, junk. I did not have a cheat day at all. And within eight to 10 months, I, I lost about six or seven kgs. And then from then on, it became such an addiction because I saw the results on the field, I felt quicker, I felt lighter, felt more focused. And then I was like, man, this is the path I want to walk. It was before all of this happened. This was when I played for the country and then I was left out. And for 13 months I wasn't selected again. And then it became sort of a madness that I want to get back up, I want to get back into the team. And then, you know, those, those 13 months I was like, I was so focused. I was so focused that I want to get back, I want to get back into the team. And my performances were such that the selectors could not ignore me after a while. So eventually I got my chance again and luckily I've never been out of the team since. This was actually 20, end of 2011, 2012, actually when we came back from Australia and I figured out the difference or the gap that we have with other countries. And I thought, if we don't change the way we are playing or I don't change the way I'm playing or the way I'm training or thinking or eating, I can never be among the best players in the world. And there's no point in just competing if you don't want to be the best. So I wanted to be the best version of myself. And then I based everything around that vision. And then my training, my diet, my approach towards the game, everything changed. And I know that I wasn't the most skilled sports person when I came in, but the only thing that's been constant is working hard on myself and my game. And that was the time I realized, well, if the Indian team has to be the best team in the world, we need to go ahead in a certain manner. I didn't feel that when I walked into play there was any kind of fear or respect in the opposition corner. So I felt like I don't want to walk into the field thinking or the opposition thinking this is just a pushover. Don't worry about this guy, he's going to do no damage to us and he's just playing just like another player in the team and stuff. I wanted to make an impact. I knew that I have the ability to make my team win and I wanted to be that version of myself where if I walk in, I wanted teams to think like, we need to get this guy out or else we're going to lose the game. So I thought, if I can't have that impact on my team, then I'm not doing justice to where I am. And if I don't want to be that guy, there's something wrong in my head. Either I've accepted being lower than what I should be, or I just don't have enough drive in me. So I said, I'm going to unlock my max potential and achieve what I should be.
